# Depression-detection-using-twitter-text-by-LSTM
The above code trains an ml model on twitter text grabbed using the tweety library in python(dataset) to classify tweets based on 3 major categories:
1) Not Depressed
2) Moderately Depressed
3) Severely Depressed

This was presented by me at my college conference with an accuracy of 85.5%.
